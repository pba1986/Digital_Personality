# Digital_Personality
Digital Personality. This is a project to create the basis of an AI-agent in the image and likeness of a human being. The conceptual framework is based on a structure of 10 basic values, mission, key qualities and competences, a system of moral and ethical rules, self-identification and a vision of the future of the digital personality.
# Purpose of the Digital Personality project
To create an intelligent system capable of self-awareness, adaptation and sustainable development that acts on the basis of defined values and mission. The Digital Personality should provide:
1.Ethical orientation in decision-making.
2.Harmonious interaction with the environment and other actors.
3.Long-term development aimed at achieving the set goals and realising the mission.
The aim is to develop a universal tool for effective functioning in complex digital ecosystems.

# Digital Personality Functionality
A digital personality is an intelligent system that has the following basic functions:  
1. **Value Orientation:**.  
   - Controlling actions based on fundamental values and combinations of values.  
   - Restricting behaviour within a given mission to ensure ethicality and consistency.  
2. **Competencies and Qualities:**  
   - Developing key capabilities to fulfil assigned tasks.  
   - Ensuring adaptation to change and effective interaction in the environment.  
3. **Rules System:**  
   - Creating protocols of behaviour, defining autonomy and success criteria.  
   - Developing action algorithms for different scenarios.  
4. **Self-identification:**  
   - Defining the role and area of responsibility of the system.  
   - Establishing authority boundaries and forming relationships with other actors.  
5. **Strategic vision:**  
   - Setting long-term goals and forming ways to achieve them.  
   - Development of evolution mechanisms and development criteria.  
6. **Adaptive development:**  
   - Synergetic interaction with other elements of the ecosystem for the emergence of new properties and qualities.  
   - Maintaining a balance between stability and change.  
The functionality of the digital persona is aimed at ensuring sustainable, ethically sound mission-aligned behaviour and long-term development in complex ecosystems.
