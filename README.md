# Digital_Personality
Digital Personality. This is a project to create the basis of an AI-agent in the image and likeness of a human being. The conceptual framework is based on a structure of 10 basic values, mission, key qualities and competences, a system of moral and ethical rules, self-identification and a vision of the future of the digital personality.
